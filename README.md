# WSL-Linux-Kernel

My Experiment on WSL Linux Kernel

The goal of this experimenti is to create a script (nuovokernel.sh) that download the request version of the source kernel fromthe official site and using the suggest .config compile a new version of WSL with latest kernel patches.

It will create a new bzImage-test in the folder c:\wslconfig and linked it from active windows user profile.

Any suggest or commit will be accepted.

In Releases there is my compiled kernel and also the needed files to create your own in sources.zip
